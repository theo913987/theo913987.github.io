<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student (Class of 2022) at the 
<a href="https://ccst.tyut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science and Technology</a>, 
<a href="https://www.tyut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Taiyuan University of Technology (TYUT)</a>, 
supervised by Associate Professor Yongfei Wu. I am currently a member of the Intelligent Medicine and Biometric Research Laboratory (IMBR) at TYUT. 
My research primarily focuses on medical image analysis, including weakly supervised classification and segmentation of pathological and endoscopic images.


In addition to my core research in medical imaging, I am also deeply interested in emerging areas such as large language models and their interdisciplinary applications, as well as multimodal learning, foundation models in vision, and weakly supervised learning. I am always eager to explore new ideas, equipped with a strong willingness and ability to learn, and I look forward to growing together with my future advisor through collaborative research and continuous exploration.

If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, feel free to contact me via the provided details!

    <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We propose DSAGL, a novel weakly supervised classification framework that integrates a dual‑stream structure and a teacher–student mechanism to jointly enhance instance‑level and bag‑level performance.</li>
      <li>An alternating training strategy is introduced to improve semantic consistency and enable effective collaboration between the teacher and student branches.</li>
      <li>We design a lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) and a scale‑aware attention module (FASA) to balance efficient long‑range modeling and focus on diagnostically critical regions.</li>
      <li>DSAGL consistently outperforms representative MIL‑based methods on both synthetic and real‑world pathological datasets at the instance and bag levels.</li>

    <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We propose FALMIL, a frequency-aware linear MIL framework for efficient weakly supervised lesion segmentation in WSIs using only image-level labels.</li>
      <li>We design a dual-domain encoder combining learnable frequency features with Mamba-based long-range instance modeling under linear complexity.</li>
      <li>Without any soft-label refinement, FALMIL directly uses binarized CAMs as pseudo masks, achieving competitive performance on challenging pathology datasets.</li>
